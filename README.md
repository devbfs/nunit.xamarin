# NUnit 3 Xamarin Runners

## Unity 5.5 Device Build Compatibility Fork
This fork is designed to be used with the [Unity Compatibility NUnit](https://github.com/devbfs/nunit) fork to allow NUnit tests to be run on device. To use this version of the runner, take the 3 classes in the Helpers subfolder (NUnitResultSummary.cs, NUnitTestPackage.cs, and NUnitTestRunResult.cs) and include them alongside the unity_compat_nunit.framework.dll from the framework fork.
